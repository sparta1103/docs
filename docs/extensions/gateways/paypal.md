## Obtaining API Credentials

### Sandbox Mode
**NOTE:** You should always test the billing system with Sandbox mode before accepting payments from your clients.

Log into [PayPal Developer dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts/) and create a new sandbox account.

View the **Business** sandbox account's API credentials. Copy the **NVP/SOAP Sandbox API Credentials** and paste them into the PayPal settings page in PteroBilling. You may leave the other settings blank. Click `Save Changes` and `Reload Config`.

### Live Mode
Log into your PayPal account and go to this page: [https://www.paypal.com/businessprofile/mytools/apiaccess/firstparty/signature](https://www.paypal.com/businessprofile/mytools/apiaccess/firstparty/signature). Then, copy the **NVP/SOAP Sandbox API Credentials** and paste them into the PayPal settings page in PteroBilling. You may leave the other settings blank. After that, click `Save Changes` and `Reload Config`.
