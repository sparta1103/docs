## Am I allowed to remove or hide the 'Powered by PteroBilling' link at the footer?
No, PteroBilling is licensed under the MIT license, which requires you to preserve the copyright and license notices. If you really want to remove the link, please consider donating to us.

## Does PteroBilling support Pterodactyl v0.7 or below?
No, Pterodactyl v0.7 has already been abandoned. Please update it to v1.4 or above as soon as possible.

## Does PteroBilling support Pterodactyl v1.0 - v1.3?
Yes, but we'll drop the support of the outdated versions soon. Please update it to v1.4 or above as soon as possible.

## Can I install PteroBilling and Pterodactyl panel on the same server?
Yes, you can. In fact, it is much easier to install PteroBilling on the server which hosts/contains the Pterodactyl panel. Since they use the same dependencies, you don't need to take extra steps when installing them on the same server. Therefore, you can safely skip the steps on the [requirements page](start/require) and follow the rest of the [getting started section](start/install).

## Can I install PteroBilling and Pterodactyl Wings (nodes) on the same server?
Yes, that is also possible. In most cases, they don't have any incompatibility. However, you have to install and set up the [required dependencies](start/require) before installing PteroBilling.

## Can I install PteroBilling on shared hosting?
PteroBilling and Laravel 8 don't officially support shared hosting environment. However, you may succeed if your web hosting provider gives you SSH access (for running Composer and Artisan commands). If you don't have SSH access, there is a high chance you will fail.

## When PteroBilling will be ready ?
We doesn't know, we are working on it as much as we can to publish it as soon as possible. Any help for the development is the welcome.
